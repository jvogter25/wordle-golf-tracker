# Wordle Golf Tracker - Website Overview & Current State

## **Project Overview**

The Wordle Golf Tracker is a web application that gamifies the daily Wordle puzzle by treating each attempt as a "golf stroke." Users compete in groups to achieve the lowest scores, with comprehensive tournament systems, leaderboards, and social features.

## **Core Concept**
- **Wordle Golf Scoring:** 1 attempt = 1 stroke, 2 attempts = 2 strokes, etc.
- **Lower scores are better** (like real golf)
- **Group-based competition** with tournaments and leaderboards
- **Social features** including profiles, avatars, and group management

- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom HSL color variables
- **UI Components:** Custom components with Lucide React icons
- **State Management:** React Context (AuthContext, GroupContext)

### **Backend & Database**

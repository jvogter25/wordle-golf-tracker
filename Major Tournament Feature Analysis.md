# Major Tournament Feature Analysis

## 2025 Golf Major Tournament Schedule

Based on the official 2025 golf major championship schedule, here are the four major tournaments that would align with your Wordle Golf Tracker:

| Tournament | Dates | Venue |

## Tournament Mechanics Design

### Tournament Structure
**Monday-Thursday: Qualifying Rounds**
- All group members submit their daily Wordle scores as normal
- These four scores count as "qualifying rounds" for the major tournament
- System tracks cumulative performance across the four days
- Real-time leaderboard shows current qualifying standings

**Friday: The Cut**
- After Thursday's Wordle submission deadline (PST), system calculates cut line
- Top 50% of participants advance to weekend rounds
- Cut line determined by total strokes across four qualifying days
- Tie-breaking system: better handicap index advances tied players

**Saturday-Sunday: Championship Rounds**
- Only players who made the cut can compete in weekend rounds
- Weekend scores count toward final tournament standings
- Final leaderboard combines all six days of competition
- Tournament champion determined by lowest total score across six rounds

### Tie-Breaking System
**Primary Tie-Breaker: Total Score**
- Lowest combined score across all tournament days wins

**Secondary Tie-Breaker: Weekend Performance**
- If tied on total score, best weekend performance (Sat + Sun) wins

**Tertiary Tie-Breaker: Current Handicap Index**
- If still tied, player with lower handicap index wins (better golfer)

**Final Tie-Breaker: Most Recent Week Performance**
- If handicaps are identical, best average score from week prior to tournament

### Tournament Scoring
**Qualifying Cut Calculation:**
```javascript
// Example with 10 players
const qualifyingScores = [
  {player: "Alice", total: 8, handicap: 2.1},
  {player: "Bob", total: 10, handicap: 3.2},
  {player: "Carol", total: 12, handicap: 4.1},
  // ... etc
];

const cutLine = Math.ceil(qualifyingScores.length * 0.5); // Top 50%
const qualifiers = qualifyingScores
  .sort((a, b) => a.total - b.total || a.handicap - b.handicap)
  .slice(0, cutLine);
```

## Database Schema Extensions

### Tournament Tables
```sql
-- Major tournaments configuration
CREATE TABLE major_tournaments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name TEXT NOT NULL, -- "The Masters", "PGA Championship", etc.
  year INTEGER NOT NULL,
  start_date DATE NOT NULL, -- Monday of tournament week
  end_date DATE NOT NULL,   -- Sunday of tournament week
  venue TEXT NOT NULL,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Tournament participants and results
CREATE TABLE tournament_participants (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  tournament_id UUID REFERENCES major_tournaments(id),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  group_id UUID REFERENCES groups(id),
  qualifying_total INTEGER, -- Sum of Mon-Thu scores
  made_cut BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  weekend_total INTEGER,    -- Sum of Sat-Sun scores (if made cut)
  final_total INTEGER,      -- Sum of all 6 days (if made cut)
  final_position INTEGER,   -- Tournament finish position
  prize_description TEXT,   -- "Champion", "Runner-up", "Made Cut", etc.
  UNIQUE(tournament_id, user_id, group_id)
);

-- Tournament daily scores (links to existing scores table)
CREATE TABLE tournament_scores (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  tournament_id UUID REFERENCES major_tournaments(id),
  score_id UUID REFERENCES scores(id),
  tournament_day INTEGER NOT NULL, -- 1-6 (Mon-Sun, no Friday)
  is_qualifying_round BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Tournament Management Functions
```javascript
// Automatic tournament creation
async function createMajorTournaments(year) {
  const tournaments = [
    {name: "The Masters", start: `${year}-04-07`, venue: "Augusta National"},
    {name: "PGA Championship", start: `${year}-05-12`, venue: "Quail Hollow"},
    {name: "U.S. Open", start: `${year}-06-09`, venue: "Oakmont Country Club"},
    {name: "The Open Championship", start: `${year}-07-14`, venue: "Royal Portrush"}
  ];
  
  for (const tournament of tournaments) {
    await supabase.from('major_tournaments').insert({
      name: tournament.name,
      year: year,
      start_date: tournament.start,
      end_date: addDays(tournament.start, 6), // Monday to Sunday
      venue: tournament.venue
    });
  }
}

// Cut line calculation (runs Friday morning PST)
async function calculateCutLine(tournamentId, groupId) {
  const qualifyingScores = await supabase
    .from('tournament_participants')
    .select('*, users(display_name, handicap_index)')
    .eq('tournament_id', tournamentId)
    .eq('group_id', groupId)
    .order('qualifying_total', { ascending: true });
  
  const cutLine = Math.ceil(qualifyingScores.length * 0.5);
  const qualifiers = qualifyingScores.slice(0, cutLine);
  
  // Update made_cut status
  for (const qualifier of qualifiers) {
    await supabase
      .from('tournament_participants')
      .update({ made_cut: true })
      .eq('id', qualifier.id);
  }
  
  return qualifiers;
}
```

    .from('major_tournaments')
    .select('*')
    .lte('start_date', gameDate)
    .gte('end_date', gameDate)
    .eq('is_active', true)
    .single();
  
  return activeTournament;
}

// Enhanced score submission
async function submitScore(userId, groupId, wordleResult) {
  // Normal score processing
  const score = await processWordleScore(userId, groupId, wordleResult);
  
  // Check for active tournament
  const tournament = await checkActiveTournament(score.game_date);
  if (tournament) {
    await addToTournament(tournament.id, score);
